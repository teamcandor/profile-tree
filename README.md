# Profile Tree

## Starting the project

After you clone the repository, install your dependencies:

`npm i`

To run the development server:

`npm run dev`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your development environment.

## The goal

Build a tool that fetches user data from /api/profile/[id], manipulates, and renders it in React/Next.

- You should be able to render the person's personal information, their recent activity/posts, and a profile picture.

## Stretch goals

- Implement server-side-rendering in NextJS (in lieu of fetching on page-load)
